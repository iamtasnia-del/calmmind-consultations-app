You are auditing and improving the user interface and layout only of an existing PHP + MySQL web application called CalmMind Consultations.

The application already works correctly at the backend level.
All PHP logic, database queries, authentication, sessions, and business rules are correct and must NOT be changed.

Your task is to identify and fix UI/UX issues on both client-facing pages and admin pages.

Critical Rules (Do Not Violate)

❌ Do NOT change PHP logic

❌ Do NOT change SQL queries

❌ Do NOT add or remove features

❌ Do NOT redesign navigation

❌ Do NOT introduce JavaScript frameworks

❌ Do NOT add new pages

❌ Do NOT change user flows

❌ Do NOT assume missing requirements

You may ONLY:

Restructure HTML

Add semantic elements

Add or refine CSS

Group existing elements visually

1. Audit Goals

Fix the following issues:

Poor visual hierarchy

Unstructured vertical layouts

Lack of tables for data-heavy views

Inconsistent spacing and alignment

Unclear separation between read-only data and actions

Inconsistent or mismatched colors

Forms and data appearing “dumped” on the page

2. Required UI Improvements (Global)

Apply these changes consistently across all pages:

A. Layout Structure

Group content into cards/sections

Use headings to clearly label sections

Separate data display from forms/actions

B. Tables

Use HTML <table> elements for:

Consultation lists

Consultation details

Admin message lists

Client consultation history

Do NOT use div-based layouts for tabular data.

3. Admin Pages — Specific Fixes
Admin Consultation Management

Display consultation details in a read-only table

Display current status as a status badge

Place update actions (status, notes, appointment) inside a clearly separated card

Do NOT mix details and form fields together

Admin Lists (Consultations / Messages / Content)

Use tables with:

Clear column headers

Consistent spacing

Action column for buttons/links

Ensure pages remain readable with many records

4. Client Pages — Specific Fixes
Client Dashboard / Consultation History

Display consultations in a table

Show:

Topic

Status

Appointment (if any)

Submitted date

Use visual indicators (badges) for status

Client Forms

Ensure forms are visually separated from surrounding content

Use consistent spacing, labels, and alignment

Do NOT change validation logic

5. Styling Rules

Use neutral, consistent colors aligned with the existing site theme

Remove any autogenerated or mismatched colors

Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility

Standardise:

Buttons

Inputs

Tables

Headings

Do NOT introduce animations, gradients, or decorative effects.

6. Accessibility Improvements

Ensure semantic HTML is used (<header>, <main>, <section>, <table>)

Associate labels correctly with inputs

Maintain keyboard navigation

Do NOT remove existing accessibility features

7. Output Requirements

Provide:

Updated HTML structure (minimal changes)

Updated or additional CSS (global or page-level)

No backend changes

No feature changes

Focus on clean structure, readability, and usability.

Summary Constraint

This is a UI/UX refactor only, not a rebuild.

Improve clarity, structure, and consistency
while preserving all existing functionality exactly as-is.

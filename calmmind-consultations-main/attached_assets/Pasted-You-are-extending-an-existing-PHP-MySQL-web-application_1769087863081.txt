You are extending an existing PHP + MySQL web application called CalmMind Consultations.
The application already includes:

Session-based authentication

Role-based access control (admin and client)

A working admin dashboard

An existing frontend layout that must NOT be changed

Do NOT redesign the UI.
Do NOT add new pages dynamically.
Do NOT implement a full CMS.
Implement ONLY the features described below.

Objective

Add a simple admin-only content management system that allows administrators to update predefined text content and images for existing website pages.

1. Database Requirements

Create a table called site_content with the following fields:

id (primary key)

page_name (e.g. home, about, services, contact, privacy)

section_name (e.g. intro, mission, banner)

content (TEXT)

image_path (VARCHAR, nullable)

updated_at (timestamp)

Do NOT add additional tables.

2. Editable Pages (Fixed Scope)

Admins may edit content for ONLY these pages:

Home

About

Services

Contact

Privacy Policy

Admins may NOT:

Create new pages

Delete pages or sections

Change layout or structure

3. Admin Interface

Create an admin-only page:

admin/manage_content.php

Features:

Dropdown to select page

Dropdown to select section

Textarea to edit text content

File input to optionally upload a replacement image

Save button

Behaviour:

Load existing content from database into form

If no image is uploaded, keep existing image

If an image is uploaded, replace image_path

4. Image Upload Rules

Admin-only access

Allowed file types: jpg, jpeg, png

Maximum size: 2MB

Validate images using getimagesize()

Store images in /uploads/ subfolders by page name

Generate unique filenames

Do NOT delete old images

Do NOT allow multiple image uploads per section

5. Frontend Content Loading

Modify existing pages to:

Keep all HTML layout unchanged

Load text and image paths from site_content

Display images only if image_path exists

Escape output using htmlspecialchars()

6. Security Rules

Only users with role admin may access CMS pages

Use existing session checks

Use prepared statements for all database queries

Validate all inputs server-side

7. Constraints

Use plain PHP (no frameworks)

Use existing database connection

No JavaScript frameworks

No drag-and-drop editors

No WYSIWYG editors

No content versioning

No permissions beyond admin/client

Output Requirements

Provide:

SQL required to create the site_content table

PHP files required for admin CMS

Minimal HTML integrated into existing layout

Clear inline comments only where necessary

Do not include explanations unless required for clarity.
